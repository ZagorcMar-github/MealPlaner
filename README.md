Project Description

The Daily Meal Plan API is an automated solution for generating personalized daily meal plans. This API is designed to help individuals, nutritionists, or meal planning apps by providing dynamically generated meal plans based on user preferences,
dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. With a focus on customization, the API enables users to receive meal suggestions that meet specific caloric and macronutrient requirements while taking into account any food allergies or intolerances.
Features

    Custom Meal Plans: Generate meal plans based on calories, macronutrient ratios (protein, carbs, fat), and dietary preferences such as vegetarian, vegan, keto, etc.
    Nutritional Tracking: Provides detailed nutritional breakdowns for each meal (calories, macronutrients, vitamins, etc.).
    Allergen Filtering: Allows users to exclude specific ingredients based on allergies or intolerances.
    Recipe Database: Includes a variety of recipes categorized by meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) that can be easily integrated into meal plans.
    Flexibility & Scaling: Plans can be created for a single day or scaled for longer periods (e.g., weekly or monthly plans).
    User Profiles: Store user preferences and past meal plans for personalized recommendations.
    API Endpoints:
        Create new meal plans
        Retrieve specific meals or recipes
        Modify or customize generated plans
        Manage user preferences and dietary needs
